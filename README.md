### Hi there, I'm Simon - aka Zerosimi 👋

### I'm currently a PhD candidate in environmental physics. 👨‍🎓

- 🔍 Focused on investigating the ratio of formaldehyde to glyoxal in the troposphere.
- 💻 Modeling the transport of chemicals with WRF-Chem and Flexpart-WRF.
- 🔭 Using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) to investigate trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I created an android app for cooking recipes (sadly not online anymore)

### Skills:
